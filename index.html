				<h2>Did you know...</h2>

				<p>
					... that the first computer program ever, was created by a woman?
					There is millions and millions of women who want to know what pushing bits is all about.
					But how to learn?
				</p>

				<p>
					Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. It's hard to feel invested
					in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q &amp; A forums where you
					don't know anyone.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, you made some cool 3D animation projects and you want
					to learn how to make your portfolio? Maybe you are a great dancer and
					you are sick of youtube interface, so you want to show all the latest moves on your
					own page.
					Maybe you just like computers and want some new friends? Or maybe you had enough
					of your dead end job and shady boss and decided the time has come for you to do
					something that you really want to do?
				</p>
				<p>Great! We're so glad you are here!</p>
				<p>
					Lets get together and teach us about stuff you know, and we will teach you
					how to dive in the software developing world. And help you become righteous
					developer.

				<h2>OK, but who are you guys?</h2>

				<p>We are a group of people, mostly women, who are getting together once a week
					and putting our brain to work. We consume chocolade and produce great software
					projects.
					Residing in Kersnikova 4, Ljubljana, Slovenia, we get together every Wednesday and work
					on our amazing projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is always space for new kittens, who want to learn how to make some software.
					If you want to learn with us, we have a litterbox just for you.
