#History of HTML

The HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. If there should be just one, thant he
 is a true and proper web developer.
 
He decided to create "hypertext" to share scientific papers, because he was sitting in
his office ar CERN Institute and, thought about how
file sharing between people there really sucks. He said there is sure a better 
way of doing this.

First web page saw the light on August 6, 1991
