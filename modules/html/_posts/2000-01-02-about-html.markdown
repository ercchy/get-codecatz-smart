#History of HTML

The HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. If there should be just one, thant he
 is a true and proper web developer.
 
He decided to create "hypertext" to share scientific papers, because he was sitting in
his office ar CERN Institute and, thought about how
file sharing between people there really sucks. He said there is sure a better 
way of doing this.

The first web page saw the light on August 6, 1991. That is not that far back really,
so there is still plenty to be discovered and built on the web. Courage dear cat!

As everything, even HTML became a super mess after a while. Everyone was understanding it
differently and implementing it the way they understood it. On top they had their own
ideas about what it should contain or how it should look like, 
so there was a desperate call for some sort of standardization from the developers
back then. it got standardized by w3 Consortium (pack of super nerds).
