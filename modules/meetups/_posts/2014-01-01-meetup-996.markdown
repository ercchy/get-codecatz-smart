#Hello you lovely folks!

With the new season of our Awesome CodeCatz meetups, we realized that this web page needs a makeover. Seriously. Like… right now. :) So… Watch out! It’s comming soon!

What’s comming, you ask?

Well, we won’t spill everything, but perhaps a proper presentation of our group is in order, don’t you think? Every one of our Catz will get a special place here. Our Catz do seriously cool stuff, which you should know about! Perhaps Kittens will get a mention as well. Dunno. We’ll see about that. ;)

Also our Manifesto is kind of…well, not. What can we say, we lazy catz. :) But, we’re also working on it. It’s comming.

Can’t say more.

Later!
