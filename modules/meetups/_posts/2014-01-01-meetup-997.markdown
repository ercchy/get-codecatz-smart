#Meetup notes: Catching up

It was a sleepy, rainy day. Most of the mentors abandoned us, so we used this week’s meeting to catch up and review stuff some kitties missed. We also welcomed a new kitty to the group and hope to see her again.

Being hosted by Celtra this week, we learned more about their rich media mobile advertising and had interesting discussions about the role of CSS, JavaScript and other stuff in a web app.

##Homework

Still waiting for all apps to have awesome [jQuery validation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/). 
Check out the [example in kibble](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble/tree/master/jQuery/2013-08-28-jquery-form-validation) 
for inspiration.

We need some presentations for next week. Add yourself to the [kibble list](https://github.com/CodeCatz/kibble)
, m’kay!
