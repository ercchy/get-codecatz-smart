## First of, join the CodeCatz 
You thought we are interesting enough, that you visited us and hopefuly we did not turn you away,
by the heaps of chocolade we offered you.

Now is time for you to tell the whole wold you are now a CodeCat and that is why
we want you to put your lovely
little face on the front page of this course.

For this you'll need an account with [Github](https://github.com/).
If you don't have one, now is the best time to create one. Go ahead and then come back.

This course is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To be presented as a proper CodeCat you'll need, to know a bit about git. 

OK, you will need to know quite a lot about git, but hey no worries, we are 
here to get you started. For now you'll just need to know how to fork repository
, how to add your lovely picture to this course and how to send a pull request, 
so we can publish it. Then we party!


<a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/ercchy/get-codecatz-smart/fork" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> Fork this repository</a>

Some of the technical things may be challenging or frustrating, but by tackling 
it bit by bit and asking your peers for help, youâ€™ll soon be an expert 
and helping other people. We promise!

### Tweak a few items. 
In your Github space there is a repository called "get-codecatz-smart". Click on it
and don't get intimidated by all the items you see inside. You do not need to 
know what they are just yet.

Find this file{% highlight yaml %}_data/course.yml{% endhighlight %}

On the top right you will see a button (little pencil), by cliking on it you are able to edit
this file.

There are two updates that you need to make to your course to get started, the first to change

{% highlight yaml %}baseurl:{% endhighlight %}

to

{% highlight yaml %}baseurl: /course-in-a-box{% endhighlight %}

in the file [https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml)

Next, delete the file called CNAME [https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/CNAME](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/blob/gh-pages/CNAME)

Now that you have a space to work, lets put a draft framework in place for your course.

### Give your course a name. 
To update the title of your course, go to [https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/](https://github.com/your-github-username/course-in-a-box/edit/gh-pages/_data/course.yml) and edit the file called `_data/course.yml`. You will see the title for this course there, change that to the name you decided on. Don't worry too much if you don't have the perfect name, you now know how to change the title for your course and you can update it at any time!

{% highlight yaml %}title: "Course Title"{% endhighlight %}

### Who is the course for & what will they learn?
Will they be building something during the course. Put this basic information on the front page of the course to give a short overview of what to expect. To update the info on the front page, go to `index.markdown` and replace the text currently there to reflect what your course will be about. Once again, you can update it at any time and we will come back to this at a later stage.

So lets have a look at your course! you can view it by going to [https://your-github-username.github.io/course-in-a-box/](https://your-github-username.github.io/course-in-a-box/), just replace your-github-username with your GitHub username.

- Ask a question on the [P2PU community forum](http://community.p2pu.org/category/tech).

You may have noticed that the `index.markdown` file contained a few funny caracters. This is called [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an easy way of writing files for the web. For some tips on how to get the most out of Markdown, see [our Markdown cheetsheet]({{site.baseurl}}/references/markdown-cheatsheet/).
 
**Possible error: pages not displayed.** You can get an email after forking the repository with the following message: "The page build failed with the following error: Page build failed". To solve this issue, check you have [enabled the automatic page generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator) on your repository. Another possible cause would be a missing whitespace in your newly added content. Double check it and commit again to trigger page generation.
